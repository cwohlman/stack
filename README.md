# Quickly build a web app with typescript and react

This originally was an idea for a bundler (you can see the readme at this commit bece93ceb6fb2c4ad042dbf6046da87942df99f3), but since there's already some pretty awesome bundlers out there, I decided to just make this some boiler plate for starting new projects.

TODO:
- Create the minimal front end react app
- Create a server side router and routes
- More advanced stuff like server side rendering & progressive web apps, etc.
